Hi, Iâ€™m @Mattkuh3205
I am a college student studying CS, focusing on learning embedded systems and robotics. I developed an interest in embedded my summer between freshman and sophomore year, 
and I fell in love with the technology.
My repo is a bit all of the place, but generally, I write mainly in C, MicroPython, and Java. My main interest right now is C and MicroPython

I would love to contribute to any projects that deal with microcontrollers and drone technology.
